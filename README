Current Features

Cube 2: Sauerbraten is an open source project, and maintains constant development, yet it is very feature-rich and playable as a game. What follows is a list of the most prominent features. 

Game Features
  * Oldskool fast & intense gameplay (read: similar to Doom 2 / Quake 1).  
  * Many multiplayer gameplay modes, most in teamplay variants as well: deathmatch, instagib, efficiency, tactics, capture (domination/battlefield style), CTF (capture the flag), coop edit (!).  
  * Masterserver & ingame server browser.  
  * Lag-free gameplay experience.  
  * Two singleplayer modes: DMSP (fight a monster invasion on any DM map), classic SP (progression driven SP like other games)  
  * 7 weapons tuned for maximum satisfaction: double barrelled shogun, rocket launcher, machine gun, rifle, grenade launcher, pistol, fist.  
Engine Features
  * 6 directional heightfield in octree world structure allowing for instant easy in-game geometry editing (even in multiplayer, coop edit).  
  * Rendering engine optimized for high geometry throughput, supporting hardware occlusion culling and software precomputed conservative PVS with occluder fusion.  
  * Lightmap based lighting with accurate shadows from everything including mapmodels, smooth lighting for faceted geometry, and fast compiles. Soft shadowmap based shadows for dynamic entities.  
  * Pixel and vertex shader support, each model and world texture can have its own shader assigned. Supports normal and parallax mapping, specular and dynamic lighting with bloom and glow, environment-mapped and planar reflections/refractions, and post-process effects.  
  * Robust physics written specifically for this world structure.  
  * Loading of md2/md3/md5/obj/smd/iqm models for skeletal and vertex animated characters, weapons, items, and world objects. Supports animation blending, procedural pitch animation, and ragdoll physics for skeletally-animated characters.  
  * Network library designed for high speed games, client/server network system.  
  * Small but complete configuration/scripting language.  
  * Simple stereo positional sound system.  
  * Particle engine, supporting text particles, volumetric explosions, soft particles, and decals.  
  * 3d menu/gui system, for in-world representation of choices.

License

The game is freeware, you may freely distribute the archive and/or installer unmodified on any media. You may re-compress using different archival formats suitable for your OS (i.e. zip/tgz/rpm/deb/dmg), any changes beyond that require explicit permission from the developers. 

You may play Cube 2: Sauerbraten for any purpose as long as you don't blame the authors for any damages incurred. 

If you want to produce new content with the Cube 2 Engine, you have to be aware that the source code may be Open Source, but the game and the media it consist of have their individual licenses and copyrights. This means that you have roughly 3 options: 
  * You may produce new content for the "Sauerbraten" game, for example as a custom map (.ogz/.cfg/textures etc). Contributing content to the original game is most welcome, and the most productive way of working with the community.  
  * If you want to create your own gameplay beyond what you can do with a map, the best way to do this is as a "mod" (same as above, but with new executable that incorporates your gameplay), that requires an existing install, and installs only the new files you created in parallel to the existing files.  
  * If you insist on making a standalone game based on Cube 2, do realize that only the sourcecode is yours to use freely (if you abide by the ZLIB license, see below), while the media is not. You can't simply redistribute the entire package with your modified files, as the majority of game media is not yours to use freely (it is made by many authors with a variety of licences and copyright restrictions). Unless you have explicit permission from the authors, or the readme says explicitly "may be used for any purpose" or similar language, it will be illegal to include in your standalone game based on the engine (you may not assume that just because a file has no explicit license, that it is free of copyright). Therefore, if you wish to produce a standalone game, be prepared to make many of the maps, models, textures, sounds etc from scratch yourself.  
In this sense Cube 2: Sauerbraten is similar to games like Quake (its code is Open Source, but its media is not), it is a game that is meant to be added to, not copied and used as a template. Sauerbraten is not meant to be a quick game creation kit, it is a game. 

If you wish to use the source code (ZLIB license) in any way, read the src/readme_source.txt file carefully.
